# Advanced Auto-Clicker

An Auto-Clicker with an ability to modify the **CPS** with a huge availability to be modded. 

E.g. the auto-clicking will stop when holding down space (aka when sprinting in game); the script has 2 simultaneous listeners: for keyboard and for controller (mouse)
and each can be modified from one-another; etc. To use it, install the requirements, simply edit the global variables at the top of the script, and run it.

The possibilities are endless. Have fun!
